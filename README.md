# Supervised Learning (classification) with Baseball Savant dataset

## Project Members:

**Data Scientists** - Joey Mathias & Daniel Torres

**Flatiron School** - Data Science Fellowship Module 5 Project

## Project Goals:

The following project consist of an exploration and analysis of Baseball for the 2019 season. Containing 35 features, out of those, 29 are continuous (launch speed, launch angle and spray angle among the most relevant) and 6 categorical.  The dataset was collected from Savant website. The scope of the project is to observe the accuracy of our models using Decision trees, Random Forest, KNN, Gradient Boost, XG Boost.
 

Research questions:
1) How strong or week is our prediction to have a single, for example, given a certain launch angle and launch speed?
2) Which Features matter the most?
3) Where does our model struggle?
4) Explore ways to improve our accuracy given the overfit in our data, by conducting SMOTE and Gridsearch.  

Exploration:

1. Decision Trees

2. Random Forest

2. KNN

3. Gradient Boost

4. XG Boost.
